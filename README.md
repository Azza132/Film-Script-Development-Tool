# REEL — Film Script Organiser
**Created by Aaron Sermon**

A browser-based script development tool inspired by Scrivener, built specifically for screenwriters. Organise your ideas, structure your story, build your characters, and track your research — all in one place. No installation required.

---

## Getting Started

1. Download `reel-script-organiser.html`
2. Open it in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
3. Click the project title at the top of the screen and rename it to your film's working title
4. Start building your project using the seven tabs along the top

All your work saves automatically to the browser. Nothing is lost when you close the tab — it will be there when you reopen the file in the same browser.

## The Interface

At the top of the screen you will find:

- The **REEL** logo and your project title (click to edit)
- **Save** — manually save your project at any time (also saves automatically as you type)
- **Export** — download your entire project as a `.json` backup file
- **Import** — load a previously exported `.json` project file
- **Seven navigation tabs** giving access to every section of the app

## The Seven Sections

---

### 1. Binder

The Binder is the heart of the app. It works like a folder structure down the left side of the screen, organising all your documents into four acts.

**Acts:**
- Act 1
- Act 2A
- Act 2B
- Act 3
- Other (for documents that do not belong to a specific act)

**To create a new document**, click the **+** button at the top of the Binder, or press `Ctrl + N` (or `Cmd + N` on Mac). A window will appear asking for:

- Title — the scene or document name
- Type — Scene, Sequence, or Note
- Act — which act it belongs to
- Synopsis — an optional one-line summary

**To open a document**, click its name in the Binder. It will open in the central editor.

**To rename a document**, right-click it in the Binder and choose Rename.

**To delete a document**, hover over it and click the small ✕ that appears, or right-click and choose Delete.

**To move a document to a different act**, right-click it and choose Move to Act.

**To duplicate a document**, right-click and choose Duplicate. Useful for creating variations of a scene.

**Writing in the editor:**
The central pane is a freeform writing area. Use it for scene notes, rough action lines, dialogue drafts, or any content you want to store with that document. There is no enforced format here — this is your development space.

**The Inspector (right panel):**
When a document is open, the Inspector on the right lets you store additional information about it:

- Synopsis — a brief summary of what happens in the scene
- Location — the scene heading location (e.g. INT. WAREHOUSE)
- Time of Day — Day, Night, Dawn, Dusk, Continuous, or Later
- Int / Ext — Interior, Exterior, or both
- Status — Draft, In Progress, Complete, or Needs Revision
- Label Colour — colour-code the document for visual organisation
- Scene Notes — private notes that do not appear in any export

---

### 2. Corkboard

The Corkboard shows all your scenes as physical index cards pinned to a board. Each card displays the scene title, synopsis, act, document type, and word count.

The coloured stripe at the top of each card reflects the label colour you assigned in the Inspector.

**To filter by act**, use the buttons along the top toolbar: All, Act 1, Act 2A, Act 2B, or Act 3.

**To open a scene for editing**, click its card. You will be taken to the Binder view with that document open.

**To add a new card**, click the **+ Add Card** button in the toolbar.

The Corkboard is ideal for getting a bird's-eye view of your story structure and spotting gaps or pacing problems.

### 3. Beat Sheet

The Beat Sheet is a story structure tool with four professional templates to choose from:

**Save the Cat** (Blake Snyder)
The most widely used modern screenwriting structure. Fifteen named beats from Opening Image to Final Image, with percentage markers showing where each beat should fall in a standard screenplay.

**Hero's Journey**
Joseph Campbell's mythic story structure as applied to film. Twelve stages from the Ordinary World through to the Return with the Elixir.

**Classic Three-Act**
The traditional dramatic structure: Setup, Confrontation, and Resolution, with key turning points mapped out.

**Eight-Sequence**
An advanced structure that breaks the story into eight distinct sequences, each with its own tension and mini-resolution.

**How to use it:**
Select a template from the dropdown at the top. Each beat appears as a row with its name, approximate page percentage, and a text area for you to write what happens at that point in your story. Each field has a descriptive placeholder to guide you.

Your content is saved automatically. You can switch between templates at any time without losing your work in any of them.

### 4. Characters

The Characters section lets you build detailed profiles for every character in your screenplay.

**To create a character**, click **+ New Character**. A form will open with fields for:

- Full Name
- Role — Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting, Minor, or Ensemble
- Age
- Occupation
- First Appears — which scene they are introduced in
- Physical Description — appearance and mannerisms
- Backstory / Biography — key history that shapes who they are
- Want vs Need — their external goal versus their deeper internal need
- Arc — how they change across the story
- Key Relationships — how they connect to other characters
- Notes — casting ideas, inspiration, anything else

**To edit a character**, click their card.

**To delete a character**, hover over their card and click the Delete button that appears.

Characters are displayed as cards showing the most important information at a glance. The first letter of their name is used as a large initial on the card.

---

### 5. Synopsis

The Synopsis section is where you develop your story at the project level, before or alongside the scene-by-scene work.

**Logline**
Write a single sentence that captures your entire film. A strong logline names the protagonist, the central conflict, and the stakes. There is a prompt in the placeholder to guide you.

**One-Page Synopsis**
A longer summary of your whole story from beginning to end — setup, confrontation, and resolution. Aim for clarity over detail.

**Genre**
Click any genre tag to select it. You can select multiple genres. Selected tags are highlighted in gold.

**Central Themes**
Note the ideas, questions, and subject matter your film explores. What is the film actually about beneath the surface?

**Tone and Visual Style**
Describe the look and feel of your film. Reference comparable films, visual inspirations, and the overall mood you are aiming for.

Everything in this section saves automatically.

### 6. Research

The Research section is a dedicated notebook for everything that informs your screenplay — reference material, historical facts, location descriptions, technical details, articles, URLs, and any other source material.

**To add an entry**, click the **+** button at the top of the left sidebar. A new entry will be created and opened automatically.

**To rename an entry**, click into the title field at the top of the main area and type a new name.

**To switch between entries**, click any entry in the left sidebar.

**To delete an entry**, hover over it in the sidebar and click the ✕ that appears.

Each entry is a freeform text area. Paste in URLs, copy in reference text, write notes — anything that helps your research process. There is no formatting enforced.

---

### 7. Timeline

The Timeline view gives you a visual column-based overview of all your scenes arranged by act.

Each act appears as a vertical column. Scenes appear as cards within their act, showing the scene title and the location information (INT./EXT., location name, time of day) pulled from the Inspector.

The left border colour of each card reflects the label colour assigned in the Inspector, making it easy to visually track storylines, tonal shifts, or any other system you use for colour-coding.

**To open a scene**, click its card. You will be taken to the editor.

The Timeline is read-only and updates automatically as you add scenes and fill in their metadata.

---

## Saving and Backing Up

**Auto-save:** The app saves your work to the browser automatically a few seconds after you stop typing. Your project will be there the next time you open the file in the same browser.

**Manual save:** Press `Ctrl + S` (or `Cmd + S` on Mac) or click the Save button at any time.

**Export:** Click the Export button to download your entire project as a `.json` file. Do this regularly as a backup, especially before clearing your browser data.

**Import:** Click Import to load a `.json` file you exported previously. This will replace the current project in the browser.

**Important:** If you clear your browser's local storage or use a different browser, your auto-saved data will not be available. Export regularly to avoid losing work.

|---|---|
| `Ctrl + S` / `Cmd + S` | Save project |
| `Ctrl + N` / `Cmd + N` | New document |
| Right-click (Binder item) | Context menu — Rename, Duplicate, Move, Delete |

## Tips for Getting the Most Out of REEL

- Build your characters before you write scenes — knowing who they are shapes every scene you write
- Fill in the Beat Sheet first if you are a planner; refer to it as you create scenes in the Binder
- Use the Synopsis logline as a north star — rewrite it regularly as the story evolves
- Colour-code your scenes by storyline (e.g. gold for the A story, blue for the B story) so the Corkboard becomes a visual structure map
- Use the Inspector status field (Draft, In Progress, etc.) to track which scenes need the most work
- Keep the Research tab open in a second browser window if your screenplay involves a lot of factual content
- Export a backup at the end of every writing session

---

## Compatibility

Works in any modern browser. No internet connection required. No plugins or extensions needed. Everything runs locally in the browser from the single HTML file.
